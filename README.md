# Sonoff-Tasmota (KNX_MOD)

This is a [MOD](https://github.com/ascillato/Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX) for Sonoff-Tasmota to integrate KNX Protocol to its features.

This MOD requires the KNX Library [ascillato/ESP-KNX-IP_Lite](https://github.com/ascillato/ESP-KNX-IP_Lite)

Basic Functionality is Available. **Work in progress**.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Road Map ##

**For Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX:**
- [x] Add Web Menu (uses the one provided by the library)
- [x] Add Feature to Receive telegrams and modify Relay Status
- [x] Add Feature to Receive telegrams from multiple Group Addresses to modify just one relay status (useful for scenes)
- [x] Add Feature to Send telegrams of relay status change
- [ ] Add Feature to Send telegrams of one relay status to multiple Group Addresses (useful for scenes)
- [x] Add Feature to Send telegrams of button pressed
- [x] Add Feature to receive telegrams to toggle relay status
- [ ] Add Feature to read Temperature from Tasmota
- [x] Add Feature to send Temperature by a set interval
- [x] Add Feature to receive command to read temperature
- [ ] Add Feature to recognize Tasmota config to show the same amount of relays, buttons, etc
- [ ] Add Feature to Save Config
- [ ] Add Feature to Load Config
- [ ] Change Web Menu to a Tasmota one to save FLASH and RAM
- [ ] Complete all the language files with keys
- [ ] Optimize code to reduce Flash and RAM

**For ESP_KNX_IP_LITE:**
- [x] Add Functions to control library from code and not only by Web Menu
- [ ] Complete needed functions for Tasmota
- [ ] Add WebUI Functions
- [ ] Change all *_id_t to config_id_t so as to have control over webpage order
- [ ] Mod GA_Register function to be similar to CB_Register (needed for Send telegrams of one relay status to multiple Group Addresses)
- [ ] Optimize code to reduce Flash and RAM

## Modifications to [Original Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota) ##

* Adding the file _/sonoff/xdrv_10_KNX.ino_ 
* Add the entry `#define USE_KNX` on _/sonoff/user_config.h_
* Add entries to the file _/sonoff/webserver.ino_
* Add entries to the file _/sonoff/sonoff.ino_
* Add entries to language files

Up to now, enabling KNX uses +14.7k of code

There is **NO CONFLICT** with MQTT, Home Assistant, Web, etc. Tests show fast response of all features running at same time.

This version is kept in sync with the Original Sonoff-Tasmota

## Sonoff-Tasmota
Provide ESP8266 based Sonoff by [iTead Studio](https://www.itead.cc/) and ElectroDragon IoT Relay with Serial, Web and MQTT control allowing 'Over the Air' or OTA firmware updates using Arduino IDE.

Current version is **5.12.0i** - See [sonoff/_releasenotes.ino](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/blob/development/sonoff/_releasenotes.ino) for change information.

### ATTENTION All versions

Only Flash Mode DOUT is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Theo's-Tasmota-Tips) for background information.

### ATTENTION Version 5 and up

These versions use a new linker script to free flash memory for future code additions. It moves the settings from Spiffs to Eeprom. If you compile your own firmware download the new linker to your IDE or Platformio base folder. See [Wiki > Prerequisite](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Prerequisite).

Best practice to implement is:
- Open the webpage to your device
- Perform option ``Backup Configuration``
- Upgrade new firmware using ``Firmware upgrade``
- If configuration conversion fails keep the webpage open and perform ``Restore Configuration``

You should now have a device with 32k more code memory to play with.

### Version Information

- Sonoff-Tasmota provides all (Sonoff) modules in one file and starts with module Sonoff Basic.
- Once uploaded select module using the configuration webpage or the commands ```Modules``` and ```Module```.
- After reboot select config menu again or use commands ```GPIOs``` and ```GPIO``` to change GPIO with desired sensor.
