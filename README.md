# ( Work In Progress ) Sonoff-Tasmota KNX

[Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX](https://github.com/ascillato/Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX) is a modification for [Sonoff-Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota) to add basic functionality of the [KNX IP Protocol](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/index.php) to its features.

This repository is kept updated with the Original Sonoff-Tasmota.

## KNX Explanation ##

The [KNX](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/knx/association/what-is-knx/index.php) IP Protocol is intended for smart home and smart bulding automation. It is a decentraliced system. Each device can talk directly to each other without the need of a central controller or server. Any panel or server is just for telesupervision and for sending requests. KNX IP Protocol uses a UDP multicast on _224.0.23.12:3671_.

Each device has a physical address ( like a MAC ) as **1 . 1 . 0** and that address is used for configuration purposes.

Each device can be configured with group addresses as **2 / 2 / 1** and that address can be used for sending/receiving commands.
So, for example, if 2 devices that are configured with the **2 / 2 / 1** for turning on/off their outputs, and other device send _Turn ON_ command to **2 / 2 / 1**, both devices will turn on their outputs.

## Integration ##

Several home automation systems have KNX support. For example, [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) has a [XKNX Python Library](https://github.com/XKNX/xknx) to connect to KNX devices using a KNX Router. If you don't have a **KNX Router**, you can use a **Software KNX Router** like [KNXd](https://github.com/knxd/knxd) on the same Raspberry Pi than Home Assistant. KNXd is used by Home Assistant for reading this UDP Multicast, although KNXd has other cool features that need extra hardware like connect to KNX devices by Twister Pair, Power Line or RF.

## Requirements ##

* [ESP KNX IP Library (async-udp branch)](https://github.com/envy/esp-knx-ip/tree/async-udp) with the modifications requested on [PR#48](https://github.com/envy/esp-knx-ip/pull/48) and [PR#52](https://github.com/envy/esp-knx-ip/pull/52)

* [ESPAsyncUDP Library](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncUDP) with the modifications requested on [PR #21](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncUDP/pull/21). This Library is used by ESP KNX IP Library. 

A copy of both libraries with the modifications needed is available at:
* https://github.com/ascillato/Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX/tree/development/lib/esp-knx-ip-async-udp
* https://github.com/ascillato/Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX/tree/development/lib/ESPAsyncUDP-master

## Development Road Map ##

**For Sonoff-Tasmota_KNX:**
- [x] Add Web Menu
- [x] Add Feature to Receive telegrams and modify Relay Status
- [x] Add Feature to Receive telegrams from multiple Group Addresses to modify just one relay status (useful for scenes)
- [x] Add Feature to Send telegrams of relay status change
- [x] Add Feature to Send telegrams of one relay status to multiple Group Addresses (useful for scenes)
- [x] Add Feature to Send telegrams of button pressed
- [x] Add Feature to receive telegrams to toggle relay status
- [x] Add Feature to read Temperature, Humidity from Tasmota
- [x] Add Feature to send Temperature, Humidity by a set interval (tasmota teleperiod)
- [x] Add Feature to receive command to read temperature, Humidity
- [x] Add Feature to recognize Tasmota config to show the same amount of relays, buttons, etc
- [ ] Add Feature to Save Config
- [x] Add Feature to Load Config
- [x] Add Log Info
- [x] Complete all the language files with keys
- [ ] Optimize code to reduce Flash and RAM

## Modifications to Sonoff-Tasmota ##

* Adding the file _/sonoff/xdrv_10_KNX.ino_ 
* Add the entry `#define USE_KNX` on _/sonoff/user_config.h_
* Add entries to the file _/sonoff/webserver.ino_
* Add entries to the file _/sonoff/sonoff.ino_
* Add entries to the file _/sonoff/sonoff.h_
* Add entries to the file _/sonoff/settings.h_
* Add entries to sensor files
* Add entries to language files

Up to now, enabling KNX uses +18k of code and +3k3 of memory.

There is **NO CONFLICT** with MQTT, Home Assistant, Web, etc. Tests show fast response of all features running at same time.

## Sonoff-Tasmota

Alternative firmware for _ESP8266 based devices_ like [iTead](https://www.itead.cc/) _**Sonoff**_, with **web**, **timers**, 'Over The Air' (**OTA**) firmware updates and **sensors support**, allowing control under **serial**, **HTTP**, **KNX** and **MQTT**, so as to be used on **Smart Home Systems**. Written for Arduino IDE and PlatformIO.

### Development:
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota)

Current version is **5.12.0j** - See [sonoff/_releasenotes.ino](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/blob/development/sonoff/_releasenotes.ino) for change information.

### Quick install

Download one of the released binaries from https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/releases and flash it to your hardware as documented in the wiki.

### Important User Compilation Information

If you want to compile Sonoff-Tasmota yourself keep in mind the following:

- Only Flash Mode **DOUT** is supported. Do not use Flash Mode DIO / QIO / QOUT as it might seem to brick your device. See [Wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Theo's-Tasmota-Tips) for background information.
- Sonoff-Tasmota uses a 1M linker script WITHOUT spiffs for optimal code space. If you compile using ESP/Arduino library 2.3.0 then download the provided new linker script to your Arduino IDE or Platformio base folder. Later version of ESP/Arduino library already contain the correct linker script. See [Wiki > Prerequisite](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Prerequisite).
- To make compile time changes to Sonoff-Tasmota it can use the ``user_config_override.h`` file. It assures keeping your settings when you download and compile a new version. To use ``user_config.override.h`` you will have to make a copy of the provided ``user_config.override_sample.h`` file and add your setting overrides. To enable the override file you will need to use a compile define as documented in the ``user_config_override_sample.h`` file.

### Version Information

- Sonoff-Tasmota provides all (Sonoff) modules in one file and starts with module Sonoff Basic.
- Once uploaded select module using the configuration webpage or the commands ```Modules``` and ```Module```.
- After reboot select config menu again or use commands ```GPIOs``` and ```GPIO``` to change GPIO with desired sensor.
